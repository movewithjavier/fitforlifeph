          <span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer" id="faq1-answer" hidden>
          <p>Unlike generic wellness programs, our solutions are specifically designed for Filipino workplace realities. We understand the unique cultural factors, dietary preferences, work schedules, and health challenges that Filipino employees face. Our programs incorporate these cultural nuances and provide practical solutions that work within the constraints of busy Filipino professional life.</p>

        <div class="faq-answer" id="faq2-answer" hidden>
          <p>Our programs are customized based on your company's size, needs, and program selection. Single webinars start at ₱15,000, while comprehensive workshops and training programs are priced based on duration, number of participants, and specific requirements. During our consultation call, we'll discuss your goals and budget to create a proposal that delivers maximum value for your investment.</p>

        <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq3-answer">
          How do we measure the ROI of wellness programs?
          <span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer" id="faq3-answer" hidden>
          <p>We work with you to establish baseline metrics before program implementation, which might include absenteeism rates, healthcare utilization, employee satisfaction scores, or productivity metrics. Our programs include pre- and post-assessments to track improvements. Additionally, we provide guidance on calculating both hard ROI (reduced healthcare costs, decreased absenteeism) and soft ROI (improved morale, engagement, and retention).</p>

      </div>
      
      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq4-answer">
          Can you accommodate different work schedules, including BPO night shifts?
          <span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer" id="faq4-answer" hidden>
          <p>Absolutely. We understand the 24/7 nature of many Filipino workplaces, especially in the BPO industry. Our programs can be scheduled across multiple shifts to ensure all employees can participate. For webinars, we provide recordings for those who cannot attend live sessions. We also design content specifically addressing the health challenges of shift work.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="faq5-answer">

          <span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer" id="faq5-answer" hidden>
          <p>We offer all three formats to suit your company's preferences and situation. Our virtual programs are designed to be highly engaging with interactive elements. In-person sessions allow for more hands-on activities and direct engagement. Hybrid programs combine both approaches to maximize accessibility. All options are available throughout Metro Manila, with select services available in other major Philippine cities.</p>

        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer" id="faq6-answer" hidden>
          <p>Timeline varies based on program complexity. Single webinars can be implemented within 1-2 weeks of approval. Comprehensive wellness workshops typically require 3-4 weeks for customization and scheduling. Full training programs usually have a 4-6 week preparation period. During our consultation, we'll discuss your timeline needs and create an implementation schedule that works for your organization.</p>
